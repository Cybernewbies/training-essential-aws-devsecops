# Essential AWS DevSecOps

We believe in thinking differently about cyber security. We believe that DevSecOps is fundamentally changing the way we build and defend computer networks and we believe there is a skills shortage. The way we must tackle the problem of skills shortage is by training up and inspiring people to persue lucarative careers in DevSecOps. We designed such course and we will be delighted if you can join us to make this vision a reality.

## Introduction

DevSecOps (sometimes refered to SecDevOps) is an approach to defensive cyber security where traditional Security Operation (secops) are automated with Development Operations (devops) typically performed by the same team. The advantage of this approach over traditional practices is that the subject networks and human processes become more reslient to attacks. This is largely due to automation, security-first planning and resilience to changes that cause regressions.

It is a mistake to think of DevSecOps as simply an automated way to build software. This is a very common misconception indeed. While it is true that creating an automated development pipeline for deliver secure software is part of the overal DevSecOps responsabilities, there is so much more to it.
